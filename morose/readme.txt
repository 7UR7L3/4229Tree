game: it`s made and tweaked for q3, but should work in any game/prog that supports quake3 standard skyboxes. Convert yourself, or contact me and I`ll do another format for you.

Use it in your map or wherever (NON-commercial use only). Just give me a credit, and  drop me a mail, I`d be glad to know.


How to use in quake:
--------------------

For q3 - just unzip all into baseq3, keeping the folder structure, everything is set for you,
then 
Goto the SCRIPTS sub-directory under the BASEQ3  and in the file SHADERLIST.TXT   
add the line at the bottom (the name of the .sahder) : space2k2
in q3 map editor use the texture called space2k2_skybox, not space2k2_view

For q2 you`d need to convert to tga and resize to 256 square I think. Put into baseq2/env folder (you need to have 256 color pcx versions for software)

For q1 requires new engine (like TQ, MHQ or Nehahra) AND you`ll need to convert this box. TQ doesnt support jpg afaik, MH quake needs 256x256 size jpg/tga/pcx(256 colors), so shrink it. Follow the instructions that come with engine. In case you want this box, but cant convert it - mail me -  I`ll do diffrent format for your needs.



Any problems - contact me.
If you like it - contact me too.
